# Technical Writing Samples

This repository contains a selection of my **technical writing samples**, including:
* notes that I took as a **volunteer notetaker** for the Paul Menton Center for Students with Disabilities
* guides that I created for students as a **teaching assistant** for the School of Mathematics and Statistics

Additional writing samples — including game documentation and rulebooks — are available on my [personal portfolio website](https://belwang.webflow.io/).
